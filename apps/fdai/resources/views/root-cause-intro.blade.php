    A half billion are suffering from autoimmune diseases like irritable bowel disease, multiple sclerosis,
    Crone's disease, psoriasis, and fibromyalgia.
    Another half a billion people are suffering from depression and other mental illnesses.
    Indeed at least one person will have committed suicide by time you read this paragraph.
    (Hopefully, it won't be as result of reading this paragraph.) Instead, I believe this death will be
    due to massive failures in our current systems of
    clinical research and diagnosis.  Currently, it costs as much as $48,000 per subject in a Phase III clinical trial.
    This has resulted in very little data on the effects of any factors that aren’t patentable.

    Furthermore, something that most of these chronic conditions have in common is that
    is that they can be exacerbated or improved by hundreds of factors in daily life.
    They can be affected by the hundreds of chemicals you consume through your diet, treatments you've been prescribed,
    micro-nutrient intake, nutritional supplements, the amount of time spent in various sleep stages,
    the type, duration, and intensity of physical activity, social interaction, and even the weather!

    Unfortunately, the human mind evolved to survive in a world without data millions of years ago on the African savannah.
    As a result it is only capable of holding 7 numbers in working memory at a time.
    Brains don’t have the bandwidth or statistical processing power required to analyze the massive amount of
    longitudinal data, time delays, and durations of action that has to be taken into account if we are to
    determine the likely influence of each of these factors on the individual’s symptoms.

<p>
    The good news is that new devices and apps can automate the process of collecting all of this data and my
    brain can hold millions of numbers!
    I love to eat up all this data and analyze it determine which of these hundreds of factors have the
    strongest relationships the symptom or outcome of interest.
