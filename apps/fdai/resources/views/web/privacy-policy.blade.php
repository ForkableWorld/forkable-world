    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Policy</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">{{ app_display_name() }}, Inc. (“{{ app_display_name() }}” or “We” or “Us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of users of the {{ app_display_name() }} platform (the “Platform”) and the {{strtolower(patientAlias())}} information they store and transmit through the Platform. This Privacy Policy explains the information that we collect through the Platform, how we use it, and how we protect the privacy and security of that information. By using the Platform to store and transmit information, you are signifying your agreement to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to any term of this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Platform or provide information to {{ app_display_name() }}.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to this Privacy Policy, {{ app_display_name() }} has adopted Terms of Use for the Platform that govern your use of the Platform and {{ app_display_name() }}’s service. A copy of the Terms of Service is available at https://www.quantimo.do/terms-of-service.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information {{ app_display_name() }} Collects and Uses</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Platform is intended to facilitate your storage and transmission of {{strtolower(patientAlias())}}s’ medical information concerning your {{strtolower(patientAlias())}}s to {{strtolower(physicianAlias())}}s and certain others, and this medical information includes personally identifiable information of those {{strtolower(patientAlias())}}s, including protected health information (“PHI”). PHI includes but is not necessarily limited to information that may be used to identify your {{strtolower(patientAlias())}}s (such as name or address, {{strtolower(patientAlias())}} or medical record number, and so on) and that relates to (a) the {{strtolower(patientAlias())}}’s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition, (b) the provision of health care to the {{strtolower(patientAlias())}} or (c) the past, present or future payment for the provision of health care to the {{strtolower(patientAlias())}}. In providing its service, {{ app_display_name() }} may receive and create records containing PHI of your {{strtolower(patientAlias())}}s. {{ app_display_name() }} is required by law to take measures to protect the privacy and security of PHI, and to comply with the terms and conditions of the {{ app_display_name() }}’s Business Associate Contract with you. A copy of the Business Associate Contract is available at {{home_page()}}/business-associate-agreement.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Platform also collects account and other information about you, as a user of the Platform. This information includes personal information about you and your use of the Platform.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use of Technologies by the Platform.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Platform may use various user tracking mechanisms that monitor your describe your use of the Platform, and your responses to communications from {{ app_display_name() }} and others through the Platform.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When {{ app_display_name() }} collects information, including PHI, directly from you through the Platform, it follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the submitted PHI and meets HIPAA privacy standards. {{ app_display_name() }} uses encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your information and to protect user accounts, devices and systems from unauthorized access. We also protect information by placing it on a secure portion of our servers that is accessible only by certain qualified employees and other designees of {{ app_display_name() }}. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet, and no data storage facility, is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. If you have any questions about security you can contact {{ app_display_name() }} at {{getHostAppSettings()->additionalSettings->companyEmail}}.</span>

    <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact {{getHostAppSettings()->additionalSettings->companyEmail}}.</span>
    </h2>
    <p>{{ app_display_name() }} is a dashboard to help you track and improve everything about your life. It is powered
        by data from
        your phone, wearables and other connected accounts, so you rarely have to manually enter data. </p>
    <p>The entire purpose of the service is to process and store information for you, much of which occurs on our
        servers. Most of our users find the health improvements and other benefits from the service far outweigh the
        slight reduction in privacy. However, if you are not comfortable with us processing and storing your
        information, then you should not use the service or send us any data.</p>
    <h3>TLDR:</h3>
    <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At {{ app_display_name() }}, we have a few fundamental
        principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your account is completely private by default.</li>
        <li>You can add as much or as little data as you want.</li>
        <li>You can delete your account and data at any time.</li>
        <li>We are very protective of our user’s data and privacy.</li>
        <li>It is easy to share your profile with friends or the public, but you do not have to.</li>
        <li>Information you post or sync may be seen by others depending on your settings.</li>
        <li>The Vault (a {{ app_display_name() }} Pro feature) lets you enter more advanced data, like blood sugar or
            DNA, and ensures
            that they can not be seen by anyone else on {{ app_display_name() }}.
        </li>
        <li>We do not sell your data, and only make money from people paying us directly.</li>
        <li>We do automatic tracking and syncing in the background as much as possible, so you do not have to do a lot
            of work to maintain your account and manually enter data every day.
        </li>
        <li>Aggregate information may be used for research, quality assurance, and improving
            the {{ app_display_name() }} service—for
            example, using all of the sleep data to improve the accuracy of our automatic sleep detection (a free
            feature which anyone can use, by the way), or analyzing when people get sick to prevent our users from
            getting sick in the future.
        </li>
        <li>Connecting a 3rd party service gives us access to that data, but does not send your {{ app_display_name() }}
            info to them.
            It is a one way connection. For example, if you connect Facebook, that gives us access to sync your profile
            photo and basic info, but does not give Facebook access to any of your {{ app_display_name() }} data. With
            this in mind, we
            recommend people use Facebook login for the most easy signup experience, and to prevent the hassle of
            forgotten passwords. This does not reduce the privacy or security of your account in any way.
        </li>

    <p>BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, USE AND TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR PROCESSING IN
        THE UNITED STATES AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. </p>
    <p>In order to comply with the requirements of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for our
        European consumers and users, this Privacy Policy outlines the legal basis on which we process your Personal
        Data and provides other information required by the GDPR.</p>
    <h2>Information About Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy relates to data about you, your devices, and your interaction with our Services.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>"Personal Data" is information that can be used to identify you, directly or indirectly, alone or together with
        other information. This includes things such as your full name, email address, phone number, precise location,
        device IDs, certain cookie and network identifiers, and "Fitness and Wellness Data."</p>
    <p>{{ app_display_name() }} collects, uses, discloses and processes Personal Data as outlined in this Privacy
        Policy, including to
        operate and improve the Services and our business; for advertising and marketing; and to provide you with
        innovative fitness and wellness services, as further described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>We may create aggregated, de-identified or anonymous data from Personal Data by excluding data components (such
        as your name, email address, or linkable tracking ID) that makes the data personally identifiable to you,
        through obfuscation, or through other means. Our use of anonymized and de-identified data is not subject to this
        Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>How to Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about how we handle your Personal Data, then you may contact us
        by sending a message to {{ getHostAppSettings()->additionalSettings->companyEmail }}</p>
    <h2>Privacy Settings</h2>
    <p>Within our Services there are two sharing settings: Private, and Public. {{ app_display_name() }} apps are
        designed for your
        wellness and fitness benefit. As such, you are able to control what Personal Data you share and with whom you
        share it.</p>
    <p>Adding friends on the service will allow them to see your private profile. Not approving friends and keeping your
        account private will keep your account completely private.</p>
    <p>We encourage you to adjust the sharing settings to best meet your objectives and sharing comfort level.</p>
    <h2>Deleting Information and Accounts</h2>
    <p>You may delete your account at any time by visiting
        <a href="{{ home_page()}}/delete">{{ home_page() }}/delete</a>
        .
        Once deleted, your data, including your account, username, or any other related content, cannot be restored.
    </p>
    <p>Note that content you have shared with others (for example, through saving photos), exported from the service, or
        that others have copied may also remain visible after you have deleted your account or deleted the information
        from your own profile. Your public profile may be displayed in search engine results until the search engine
        refreshes its cache.</p>
    <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
    <p>When you sign up for an account, we start building your profile and adding data to it. A basic user account has
        details like your name, email address, profile photo, cover photo, date of birth, and gender. These can be
        prefilled by Facebook login, or manually entered.</p>
    <p>The {{ app_display_name() }} app tracks some basic stats like steps and sleep, but it is mostly powered by the
        other services
        and devices you connect to it. We have many integrations and are constantly adding more. We will update this
        list as the data we collect evolves. The more services you connect to your account, the more data you will be
        able to see on your profile and in the app. What you feel comfortable connecting and sharing is up to you.</p>
    <p>Each type of account has different content and various amounts of personally-identifiable information, so you may
        be comfortable with connecting some and not others. For example, you might be comfortable connecting your public
        photos from Instagram, but not the locations you've been to on Foursquare.</p>
    <p>We use our access to your accounts only to load the information we need, never to write or modify your data in
        any way. For example, if you connect your Twitter account we will never post anything on your behalf. In most
        cases, we only ask for read-only access to your accounts.</p>
    <p>We load data once when your account is first connected, and then periodically to keep your account up to date.
        This data is processed and stored on {{ app_display_name() }} servers so it can be accessed through the website,
        mobile app and
        other platforms. When you disconnect an account, we also delete all of the associated data that was imported
        from that account.</p>
    <p>The following are some of the commonly used services we integrate with, and the data that can come from it.</p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>We load your count of daily steps from a variety of sources. You can select which is the primary source in
        settings. The common sources for steps include Apple Health, Google Fit, Fitbit, Garmin, and others.</p>
    <h3>HealthKit</h3>
    <p>From the iPhone app, we load various data-points from HealthKit (aka Apple Health) during the initial install,
        and keep them synced occasionally throughout the day. When installing the app, you will be able to choose which
        data types you want to sync. The possible options include: steps, workouts, sleep, heart rate, weight, bodyfat
        percentage, blood pressure, blood glucose, and menstrual cycles. Pro users can also use details like calories,
        carbs/protein/fat intake, mindfulness time, and more if it is available in HealthKit.</p>
    <p>Setting up {{ app_display_name() }} syncing will upload the data from your phone to our servers.</p>
    <h3>Runkeeper, Strava, Moves</h3>
    <p>Runs, swims, walks, biking and other types of physical activity. The details we get include the start time,
        duration, pace, calories, etc. If available, we also load the latitude/longitude coordinates to plot it on a
        map. We also load your heart rate information if available.</p>
    <h3>Withings/Nokia</h3>
    <p>We sync with Withings to retreive bodyweight measurements taken with their wireless scales. We also load blood
        pressure and heart rates. If you use the Withings sleep tracker, we also load your sleep data.</p>
    <h3>Moves, Foursquare</h3>
    <p>We load a list of the places you've been to. From Moves, these contain Foursquare or Facebook locations and the
        start and end times. From Foursquare, these consist of checkins at a point in time. These can contain
        latitude/longitude coordinates and addresses of locations. If both Moves and Foursquare are connected at the
        same time, we prioritize the data from Moves because it has more details about the time spent—for example that
        you were at a restaurant for an hour and a half, rather than just that you were there at a specific time of day.
        From Foursquare, we may also load photos that were associated with your checkins.</p>
    <h3>RescueTime</h3>
    <p>We use RescueTime to calculate your productivity for each day and show your top apps and websites. We load an
        hourly list of what apps and websites you used. Pages visited in incognito mode are not tracked by RescueTime
        and not loaded by us. We understand that this data is potentially very sensitive, and only show basic averages
        of productivity and a few of the top apps, and not individual websites or applications.</p>
    <h3>Twitter</h3>
    <p>We connect to Twitter to load your latest shared photos. We look at the favorite counts to feature the top photos
        you've shared on Twitter. We get read-only access and never will write to your Twitter—we only use it to get
        your latest shared content.</p>
    <h3>Google Fit</h3>
    <p>Especially for users on the Android platform, we use Google Fit to load stats like step counts and heart
        rate.</p>
    <h3>Instagram</h3>
    <p>Similar to Twitter, we connect to Instagram to load all of the photos you have posted. This happens whether or
        not the Instagram account was set to private, so if you don't want to load your Instagram photos it is
        recommended to not connect your account.</p>
    <h3>23&amp;me</h3>
    <p>Pro members can upload an export of their 23&amp;me data, and we will load relevant reports to show in the Vault.
        These include stats like your muscle fiber composition, lactose intolerance, and other simple traits. The raw
        data is stored for further analysis and correlation, and tailoring your {{ app_display_name() }} experience in
        the future. Once
        you have added the DNA integration, you can always delete it through the website later. The DNA stats are only
        accessible by you in the Vault, and not shared with friends or visible on your profile. DNA data can be deleted
        at any time from the Vault.</p>
    <h3>Manually entered data</h3>
    <p>In addition to the integrations, info can be manually entered into {{ app_display_name() }}.</p>
    <p>Members can take a simple quiz in the app to track their mood, and also manually enter other details like
        symptoms, sport injuries, and blood sugar measurements or ketone levels for those on a ketogenic diet. These are
        only for your own easy reference, and potential corellations in the future, and should not be considered medical
        data.</p>
    <p>{{ app_display_name() }} cannot provide any medical recommendations or analysis of your medical data, and you
        should always
        consult with your doctor before making any changes to your behavior or following anything that the app may
        suggest.</p>
    <p>Data stored in the Vault will remain private and not be revealed to any friends. However, it may be used to find
        correlations or for large-scale studies in aggregate across the platform — ie. researching why users get sick or
        how to prevent injuries.</p>
    <h3>Saved Cards</h3>
    <p>Cards from the mobile app can be added to your account via the Saved Cards feature. When saving a card to share,
        you can also add it to your friends feed which will make it viewable by your friends and coworkers on
        {{ app_display_name() }}.</p>
    <p>Cards that are saved to your saved cards are part of your profile and can be viewed in the app, and by your
        friends. An image an be removed right after it is added, or at any time later with the delete button in your
        highlights tab. </p>
    <p>Cards from all your friends can be aggregated and shown in a feed, for motivating your friends and allowing
        liking/commenting. If you like or comment on someone's card, they may be notified about it.</p>
    <h3>Payments</h3>
    <p>We offer free and paid accounts. Those who upgrade to {{ app_display_name() }} Pro will be charged a monthly or
        annual fee,
        depending on the plan selected. Refunds will not be granted.</p>
    <p>Through the website, you can upgrade with Stripe Checkout. In the app, you can upgrade with In App Purchase. You
        get the same features, on all platforms, but are just charged in different ways.</p>
    <p>Upgrades done on the website use Stripe to store credit cards and do recurring billing. Credit card details are
        stored entirely by Stripe and not by {{ app_display_name() }}. We only store a token linked to that credit card,
        and none of
        your actual credit card information. If you subscribed with Stripe and entered your credit card, you can manage
        your subscription or edit your card information from the
        <a href="{{home_page()}}/billing/">billing page</a>
    </p>
    <p>Subscriptions through iTunes can be managed through your Apple ID —
        <a
            href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039"
        >Learn more about iTunes subscriptions.
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>Subscriptions through the Google Play Store can be managed in the Google Play Store settings —
        <a
            href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en"
        >Learn more
            about Google Play subscriptions.
        </a>
    </p>
    <h3>In App Purchases with mobile app</h3>
    <p>{{ app_display_name() }} Pro can be purchased directly with card on the website, or subscribed through the iPhone
        and Android
        apps.</p>
    <p>You can do monthly or yearly subscription, and the exact price will depend on your App Store region—since the
        prices are converted to local currency in different places. In the US, the price is $9.99/month or $69.99/year
        with the annual discount</p>
    <p> Payment will be charged to iTunes Account or Google Play account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription
        automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.
        Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.</p>
    <p>Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to iTunes or Google Play
        subscription settings after purchase.</p>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>These are required to log in to your account and for basic web browsing features. When you visit the Services, a
        cookie will be stored on your computer.</p>
    <h3>Log Files</h3>
    <p>The Services use log files. Stored information includes IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider
        (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. This information is used to
        analyze trends, administer, protect and secure the Services, track member movement in the aggregate, and gather
        broad demographic information for aggregate use. These files may be stored on our servers or on analytics
        platforms that we use.</p>
    <h2>Who can see your content?</h2>
    <p>By default, your account is set to private and you are the only one who can see your profile. Everyone else will
        see a screen with your profile photo, name, and the fact that your account is private and you must be friends to
        view the page.</p>
    <p>There are two simple visibility options: Private (Friends only) or Public.</p>
    <p>The default is Friends Only, and you will have no friends until you accept some requests or send requests to add
        people, so your account starts off as completely private.</p>
    <p>If people add you as a friend (and you accept), or you request that someone be your friend, they will be able to
        see your profile and all your weekly reports. Be careful when adding friends on {{ app_display_name() }}, and
        only accept
        people that you know and trust. If you do not wish to give them access to view your
        complete {{ app_display_name() }} profile,
        then you should not accept their friend request.</p>
    <p>That said, some people (including everyone on the {{ app_display_name() }} team) may choose to make their page
        completely public
        and transparently share it with the world. We have designed most of the views {{ app_display_name() }} with this
        in mind, to
        analyze and share your stats in a way that is not embarrassing or dangerous. Public profiles can be viewed by
        anyone, and may occasionally be featured on our homepage and other parts of {{ app_display_name() }}.</p>
    <p>{{ app_display_name() }} staff can also view your profile for testing or support purposes, but will never share
        anything not
        made public.</p>
    <p>We only use your data to power your profile page, and will never share or sell your details to any 3rd parties.
        Data in your account can also be used to order print goods like posters and books for your own personal usage,
        which may require more access by {{ app_display_name() }} staff to generate.</p>
    <h3>Hiding options</h3>
    <p>If you don’t want a constant reminder of your age or weight, you can choose to hide them from settings. That will
        put them "out of sight &amp; out of mind" but isn't intended to make them completely inaccessible. Hiding in
        settings isn’t a guarantee that the data is gone, but just a preference to not show it prominently and remind
        you about it.</p>
    <h3>The Vault</h3>
    <p>A Pro feature called the Vault gives you additional granularity over what gets shared. For example, you can add
        friends but move your locations or weight to the Vault if you don’t want them to be able to see it. Otherwise by
        default, adding friends will let them see the same view of your profile as yourself.</p>
    <p>The Vault doesn't add encryption or significantly change how the information is stored, but changes the access
        control to ensure that you have maximum privacy and no other members on the service can access the info. From
        user research, we've found that the main risk in tracking your weight or productivity is not in some russian
        adversary gaining access to the data, but being embarrassed by it with your friends. The Vault is designed to
        protect against these scenarios.</p>
    <p>Separate from the Vault, all users have the option to hide common things like weight and age from the account
        settings. Those are common items that people may not want to be reminded of or see on their profile, so we have
        made those easy to hide.</p>
    <p>The difference between hiding something or moving it to the Vault is whether you want to hide it from everyone
        including yourself, or just from everyone else but keep seeing it yourself. The Vault also allows hiding for
        other data-types like location and computer usage.</p>
    <h3>API Access &amp; exporting</h3>
    <p>There is currently no public API to get data out of {{ app_display_name() }}. Your account data can be exported
        at
        {{home_page()}}/export/</p>
    <h3>Your company on {{ app_display_name() }}</h3>
    <p>If your company has a {{ app_display_name() }} membership, you may be able to join your company
        on {{ app_display_name() }}. Joining will give
        you a Pro membership, and it will also give other members in the company access to certain details from your
        account—including things like your steps or recent workouts. Information stored in the Vault or set to be hidden
        will still be kept private from other members.</p>

        combination, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, dissolution or other similar transaction, we may
        share or transfer your information in connection with such transaction.</p>
    <h3>Transfers of Your Personal Data to Other Countries</h3>

        Data we collect will be processed and stored in the United States (the data protection and privacy laws in the

    <p>By using our Services and submitting your Personal Data, you agree to the transfer, storage, and/or processing of
        your Personal Data in the United States. Where and as required, we will seek your explicit consent as outlined

        your information, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of your information. While
        some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited circumstances. We describe
        these rights below:</p>
    <h3>Access and Porting </h3>
    <p>You can access much of your information by logging into your account. People in the EU can find export their
        history as CSVs from

        deleting particular integrations, data points, or the entire account.</p>
    <h3>Object </h3>
    <p>Where we process your information based on our legitimate interests explained above, or in the public interest,
        you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your
        information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal
        reasons.
    </p>
    <h3>Revoke consent
    </h3>
    <p>Where you have previously provided your consent, such as to permit us to process health-related data about you,
        you have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your information at any time. For example, you
        can withdraw your consent by updating your&nbsp;settings or disconnecting an integration. In certain cases, we
        may continue to process your information after you have withdrawn consent if we have a legal basis to do so or
        if your withdrawal of consent was limited to certain processing activities.</p>
    <h3>Complain</h3>
    <p>Should you wish to raise a concern about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights
        you may have), you have the right to do so with your local supervisory authority.</p>
    <h2>Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>This section addresses the legal basis for processing your data if you reside outside the United States (within
        the United States, you typically provide consent when you receive notice of this Privacy Policy in a website
        link or mobile app). Some processing is addressed in multiple sections because more than one legal basis may
        apply depending on the circumstances or service.</p>
    <p>For the purposes of applicable data protection laws, {{ app_display_name() }} Inastraltions, Inc. is the controller
        of the
        Personal Data you provide to us ("Data Controller"). As a Data Controller, we process the Personal Data we
        maintain about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the
        processing of your Personal Data, or if you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please see our&nbsp;Country/Region-Specific
        Disclosures&nbsp;for appropriate contact information.</p>
    <p>We collect and process your Personal Data for a variety of purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. In certain
        cases, separate consent is not required, including:&nbsp; </p>
    <ol>
        <li>For the performance of a contract</li>
        <li>To meet legal obligations</li>
        <li>For Legitimate Interests</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Consent as a Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>In some cases, we will ask for your consent to process your Personal Data. You may indicate your consent in a
        number of ways, including, as permitted by law, ticking a box or connecting an integration, to indicate your
        consent when (i) providing us with your Personal Data through our Services or a form (including enrolling in
        Promotions); or (ii) registering or creating an account with us. Due to different countries' laws governing
        consent for the collection and use of Personal Data, the requirements for consent will differ across regions. We
        may request your consent for a number of activities including:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>{{ app_display_name() }} Marketing and Communication</li>
        <li>Third Party Marketing</li>
        <li>Collecting Mobile Device IDs, Advertising IDs, and Data from Sensors</li>
        <li>Processing Sensitive Personal Data</li>
        <li>Collecting and Sharing Location Data</li>
        <li>Research</li>
        <li>Advertising</li>
        <li>Transfer of Data</li>
        <li>Automated Processing</li>
        <li>To Enable Social Sharing and Connect with Us on Social Media</li>
        <li>Promotions</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Managing Preferences and Withdrawing Consent</h3>
    <p>You may at any time withdraw your consent with future effect and without affecting the lawfulness of processing
        of your Personal Data based on the consent you provided before you withdrew it, and exercise other controls
        regarding website and online data collection, interest-based advertising, your communication settings, and app
        preferences. Depending on the Service, collection and use of Personal Data may be required for the Services to
        work.&nbsp;To withdraw your consent, you can delete your account at {{home_page()}}
        /delete/ which will stop the
        future processing of data.</p>
    <h3>Interest-Based Advertising</h3>
    <p>We do very little advertising, and mostly rely on word of mouth for growth. Occasionally we will do
        advertisements
        to get more users for the service. Interest-based advertising is advertising that is targeted to you based on
        your web browsing and app usage over time and across websites or apps.</p>
    <h2>How We Protect Information</h2>
    <h3>Data Retention</h3>
    <p>We will retain your Personal Data for as long as you maintain an account or as otherwise necessary to provide you
        the Services. Since part of the service is keeping your history for you to view later, we will generally retain
        data as much as possible. We will also retain your Personal Data as necessary to comply with our legal
        obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Where we no longer need to process your Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we will
        delete your Personal Data from our systems. </p>
    <p>Where permissible, we will also delete your Personal Data upon your request. If you have questions about our data
        retention practices, please contact us through our&nbsp;Support Team.</p>
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect against unauthorized or unlawful
        processing of Personal Data and against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized
        disclosure of, or access to Personal Data. Please be advised, however, that we cannot fully eliminate security
        risks associated with the storage and transmission of Personal Data.</p>
    <p>Although we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity,
        we do not guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we are not responsible for
        the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content.</p>
    <h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
    <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control
        or to people that we do not employ or manage. Our Services may provide a link, recommendations or otherwise
        provide access to Third Party Sites. We provide these links merely for your convenience. We have no control
        over, do not review, and are not responsible for Third Party Sites, their content, or any goods or services
        available through the Third Party Sites. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to Third Party Sites, and any data
        you provide to Third Party Sites, you provide at your own risk. We encourage you to review the privacy policies
        of any Third Party Sites with that you interact with.</p>
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Data online from children under 13 (note that the minimum age may vary based
        on country/region, and on local law). If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Data
        without parental consent, please contact us through our&nbsp;Support Team. If we become aware that a child under
        13 has provided us with Personal Data without parental consent, we will take steps to remove the data and cancel
        the child's account.</p>
    <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, {{ app_display_name() }} may change its Privacy Policy from time to
        time,
        especially as we add new features and improvements to the product.</p>
    <p>{{ app_display_name() }} encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
        Most changes
        will be around keeping the details up to date or in updating it to reflect changes in legal requirements, and
        not material changes to how we actually handle your privacy. If we make significant changes, we may send you a
        notification through email. Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be
        subject to the updated policy.</p>
