This Netatmo API PHP library is a wrapper for the Netatmo API. It is based on the great work at https://github.com/Netatmo/Netatmo-API-PHP 

It was copied to the project because it had to be modified and the original project is not maintained anymore.

If you'd like to
- fork the original version and
- make it work with the project's Guzzle version and
- add as a composer.json dependency
 
please do so and submit a pull request.
