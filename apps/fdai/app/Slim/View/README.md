View - The "V" in "MVC"

The View's job is to translate data into a visual rendering for response to the Client
(ie. web browser or other consumer).

The data will be supplied primarily by the Controller; however, the View may also have a helper that can retrieve data
that is associated with the rendering and not necessarily with the current request (ex. aside data, footer data).
