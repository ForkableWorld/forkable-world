We can never know for sure if one factor is definitely the cause of an outcome.\n                However, lack of correlation definitely implies the lack of a causal relationship.  Hence, we can with great\n                confidence rule out non-existent relationships.  For instance, if we discover no relationship between mood\n                and an antidepressant this information is just as or even more valuable than the discovery that there is a relationship.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                We can also take advantage of several characteristics of time series data from many subjects\n                to infer the likelihood of a causal relationship if we do find a correlational relationship.\n                The criteria for causation are a group of minimal conditions necessary to provide adequate\n                evidence of a causal relationship between an incidence and a possible consequence.\n            </p>\n            <h3> Criteria For Causal Inference</h3>\n            <h4 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold\">\n                Strength (A.K.A.

Furthermore, in accordance with the law of large numbers (LLN), the predictive power and accuracy of these results will continually grow over time.  743 paired data points were used in this analysis.   Assuming that the relationship is merely coincidental, as the participant independently modifies their Indoor CO2 values, the observed strength of the relationship will decline until it is below the threshold of significance.  To it another way, in the case that we do find a spurious correlation, suggesting that banana intake improves mood for instance, one will likely increase their banana intake.  Due to the fact that this correlation is spurious, it is unlikely that you will see a continued and persistent corresponding increase in mood.  So over time, the spurious correlation will naturally dissipate. \n            </p>\n            \n            <h4 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold\">\n                Specificity\n            </h4>\n            <p>\n                Causation is likely if a very specific population at a specific site and disease with no other likely explanation. The more specific an association between a factor and an effect is, the bigger the probability of a causal relationship.\n            </p>\n            \n            <h4 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold\">\n                Temporality\n            </h4>\n            <p>\n                The effect has to occur after the cause (and if there is an expected delay between the cause and expected effect, then the effect must occur after that delay). The confidence in a causal relationship is bolstered by the fact that time-precedence was taken into account in all calculations.\n            </p>\n            \n            <h4 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold\">\n                Biological Gradient\n            </h4>\n            <p>\n                Greater exposure should generally lead to greater incidence of the effect.
