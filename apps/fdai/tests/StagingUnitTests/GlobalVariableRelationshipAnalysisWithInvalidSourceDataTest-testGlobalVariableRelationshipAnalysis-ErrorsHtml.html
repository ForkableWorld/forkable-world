Cannot calculate tValue or confidence interval because standard error is 0. There is not variance in the data to create a study on the relationship between Air Quality Index and Hypomania. There are 5 changes in the value of the Air Quality Index and 1 changes in Hypomania during the 6 from 2018-02-14 11:10:56 to 2018-02-21 03:47:02 At least 1 changes in values are necessary because we're trying to see what happens to Hypomania when Air Quality Index is above average and what happens when it's below average. </p>
