# ðŸ¤– Forkable World ðŸ’Š

The Forkable World project is designed to help our institutions promote the general welfare through the principles of open-source software development and artificial intelligence. It contains applications and AI agents that support non-profit organizations and governments in their missions to create public goods and improve societal outcomes.

### Key Components

- **[FDAi](apps/fdai):** An example [application](apps/fdai) within the Forkable World ecosystem, designed to allow individuals to import data about their health, as well as information about the food and drugs they consume, to calculate and understand the effects on their health. This AI-driven app aims to provide personalized advice, answer questions, and offer guidance based on comprehensive data analysis.

- **Co-Budgeting:** Another application intended to enable collective intelligence in the allocation of resources. It allows communities or organizations to collaboratively decide on the distribution of funds among different projects or initiatives, enhancing transparency and participation in budgetary processes.

- **Documentation:** The repository also aims to contain all relevant laws and constitutional documents in a format that encourages iterative improvement and adaptation. This component is crucial for ensuring that any changes or forks of the project can be legally informed and grounded in a solid understanding of existing legal frameworks.

- **Open-Source and Collaborative Development:** The project is fundamentally open-source, meaning anyone with an idea to improve it can fork the repository, make changes, and submit those changes back to the main project through pull requests. This collaborative approach allows for continuous improvement based on wide-ranging input and real-world testing.

- **Data-Driven Governance:** By enabling jurisdictions to fork the repository, implement changes, and then measure the effects on health, wealth, and happiness, the project aims to create a data-driven approach to governance. This approach would allow for the collection of econometric data on policy effects, informing future decisions with empirical evidence.

- **Dynamic and Iterative Improvement:** Borrowing from software development practices, the Forkable World project advocates for governance to be a living system that evolves through iteration, feedback, and gradual rollouts of policy changes. This adaptive model contrasts with static governance structures, aiming instead for continual refinement and responsiveness to new information.

- **AI and Autonomous Agents:** A significant part of the project involves coding much of governmental functions and services using AI and autonomous agents. This approach seeks to standardize procedures, reduce biases, and ensure that evidence-based public policy can be effectively analyzed and implemented.

### Goals

The overarching goal of the Forkable World project is to demonstrate that governance, like software, can benefit from open-source principles, data-driven decision-making, and the innovative use of technology to serve public interests more effectively. It aims to foster a more participatory, transparent, and responsive model of governance that can adapt to the needs and challenges of modern societies.

### Project Structure
- `/apps` contains individual folders for each government department or function, such as the FDA, SEC, etc. Each 'app' functions as a standalone module with its own resources, but can share common utilities and libraries.
  - `/fdai` for gathering and analyzing information from individuals about food, drug intake, and symptoms.
  - folders for other apps supporting other organizations or functions
- `/libs` contains reusable libraries and utilities that can be imported by any app, promoting code reuse and reducing duplication. This could include data processing utilities, AI models, common web components, and more.
- `/docs` Holds all the documentation related to the project, including:
  - `/laws` for legal documentation and laws related to each department's function.
  - `/guides` for how to contribute to the project, use the APIs, etc.
  - `/api-docs` for detailed API documentation.
- `/tools` contains scripts and tooling for building, deploying, and managing the applications, including custom scripts for database migrations, deployment automation, and other development operations tasks.

### Contributing

Think something is missing or needs improvement? Please fork the repository and make it your own! We welcome all contributions, whether it's a bug report, feature request, or a pull request.

The goal is to create 8 billion forks of this repository, one for each person on the planet. Each fork can then be customized to meet the needs of the individual, community, or jurisdiction that created it. This approach allows for a wide range of experimentation and adaptation, while still benefiting from the collective intelligence of the entire Forkable World community. 

### Contact

If you have any questions or would like to get in touch with the project maintainers, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/ForkableWorld/forkable-world/issues) or post in our [Discussions](https://github.com/ForkableWorld/forkable-world/discussions) forum.

We're always happy to hear from others who share our passion for open-source governance and data-driven decision-making!
